### How do i run this?
#### Install Node.js
First you need to have **Node.js** installed on your PC or Server (whereever you will run your bot.)
It would take a lot of time for me to teach you how to install **Node.js** on your Operating System, so please install **Node.js** and come back to here.

#### Installing Dependencies
We need to install **Discord.js** library in order to get everthing working.
You need to install **Discord.js** library with **NPM (Node Package Manager)**
We already included a **package.json** file that will tell **NPM** which dependencies needs to be installed
You need to do ```npm install``` or ```npm install discord.js```

Wait for it to be installed.

#### Get a token from Discord if you didn't.
You need to navigate to [discordapp.com/developers](https://discordapp.com/developers) and create an application.
After you name your bot and create the app, navigate to **"Bot"** tab and create a bot account for your application.
Copy the token and enter it to **config.json**

### Run the application
Run Node.js client, navigate to the folder that you downloaded the files and type `npm start` or `node index.js`
You're all ready!
